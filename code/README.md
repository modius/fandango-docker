# Project Code Base

Map your project codebase into this directory by:

- using git submodules, or;
- fc-deploy.sh repos under this directory

A common directory structure for FarCry framework projects would be:

```
.
├── core
├── plugins
│    └── googleanalytics
└── projects
    └── myproject
```

**Do not commit code to this folder structure directly.**
